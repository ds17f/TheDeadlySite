## Key points for App Review

- Archive.org hosts the Grateful Dead collection and provides guidance that sites/services should be non-commercial when offering the files; Archive‚Äôs ‚ÄúRights‚Äù page quotes the band‚Äôs _no commercial gain_ guidance and explains Archive‚Äôs interpretation. (See the ‚ÄúRights‚Äù and Grateful Dead collection help pages linked above.)
- Some shows are **stream-only** at the request of the band (Archive documents this on the collection help page).
- This app functions as a noncommercial client/browser that references Archive-hosted files; it does not permanently host or monetize those recordings.
