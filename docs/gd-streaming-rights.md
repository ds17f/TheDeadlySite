## üîë Historical Grateful Dead Policy (Archived Excerpt)

Below is the official policy statement from **Grateful Dead Productions**, as captured by the Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback Machine (2005).  
This statement remains the basis for the **noncommercial sharing permissions** referenced on Archive.org:

> ‚ÄúThe Grateful Dead and our managing organizations have long encouraged the purely non-commercial exchange of music taped at our concerts.  
> No commercial gain may be sought by websites offering digital files of our music, whether through advertising, exploiting databases compiled from their traffic, or any other means.  
> All participants in such digital exchange acknowledge and respect the copyrights of the performers, writers, and publishers of the music.  
> This notice should be clearly posted on all sites engaged in this activity.  
> We reserve the ability to withdraw our sanction of non-commercial digital music should circumstances arise that compromise our ability to protect and steward the integrity of our work.‚Äù
